## COVID-19 Risk Factors Assessment: Analysis and Predictive Model

COVID-19, a recently identified viral infection, exhibits primarily mild to moderate respiratory symptoms in the majority of cases, with most individuals recovering without the need for specialized medical intervention. However, it poses a significantly increased risk of severe illness in older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as respiratory and renal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity. The pandemic has underscored the pressing issue of medical resource scarcity and the challenges associated with the efficient allocation of these resources. The ability to predict medical needs in advance or upon confirmation of a COVID-19 diagnosis could substantially enhance the capability of health authorities to effectively manage and allocate essential resources, thereby saving lives.

This project aims to delineate the pivotal correlations between COVID-19, concurrent medical conditions, and survival probabilities. It further proposes a machine learning model for predicting the risk for COVID-19 patients by analyzing their overall health status and medical history.

The dataset, provided by the Mexican government, contains anonymized records for over one million patients divided into 21 features. The exploratory data analysis has revealed the significant risk elevation associated with age, underscoring the importance of protective measures for the elderly. Additionally, the analysis thoroughly evaluated the impact of pre-existing conditions, highlighting the heightened risks posed by respiratory and renal diseases. The study indicates that the presence of the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 positive patients—hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and pneumonia—can decrease the survival probability to 42% if all are present.

As the dataset is labeled, it allows the application of supervised learning techniques to develop a classification model. A key challenge in this dataset is its imbalance, not only in the target variable (survival status, with approximately 93% of patients surviving) but also in the distribution of medical histories (with comorbidities often present in only a small fraction of patients). Moreover, the dataset predominantly represents the Mexican population, characterized by a younger demographic compared to the elderly. Despite these limitations, a machine learning model was developed and fine-tuned, achieving a 95% recall rate and a 0.36% false negative rate. Utilizing this model, 88% of patients can be accurately assessed according to their risk status, with 11% potentially receiving more cautious evaluation than necessary. The model exhibits a marginal error rate, failing in approximately 3.6 instances per 1000 patient evaluations.
